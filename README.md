# Embedded Device Configurator
CopperSpice based application for configuring any Embedded device

## Setup development environment
The application is set up to mostly work out of the box. The only thing that (currently) has to be installed is CopperSpice. 
For this, following the instructions in the [CopperSpice documentation](https://www.copperspice.com/docs/cs_overview/main-install.html).
After installing CopperSpice make sure the location of the CopperSpice cmake files is in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH environment variable.
